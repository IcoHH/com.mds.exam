This is Java web application which is suppose to be new virtual web web product . <br>
Until now this the only think that this Java application provides is a json <br>
formatted list of vessels which is accessible through alias <br>
 “/com.mds.exam/JsonProviderServlet” when the application is deployed. In order to<br> 
 improve the look and feel of the list we need the following:<br>
      1. This list which is provide by this application is hard coded in the java <br>
         code. In order to make our application more flexible, propose a change of <br>
         JsonProviderServlet to provide dynamic list of vessels. Read the vessel <br>
         list from a vessels.csv file in which is in the webapp folder.<br>
      2. Create a front page which will display the vessel list provided by the <br>
         JsonProviderServlet. Make a good looking table with all available vessel data.<br>
      3. Create sort and filtering functionality for the table from the previous point<br>
